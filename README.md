# Tinder Clone

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Building a Tinder clone to learn the basics of a matching/messaging web application.

The workflow so far:

- Set up a MongoDB cluster with user and messages collections with sample data
- Initialize with CRA
- Create skeleton pages for Home, Dashboard, and Onboarding
- Set up routing with `react-router-dom`
- Set up Home page and style
- Create NavBar component
- Create AuthModal component
- Set up Onboarding page with account creation form and style
